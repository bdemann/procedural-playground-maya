I would like to be able to
add a random height to each platform. I think just 1 2 or 3
	actually I think I want the user to be able to input what the max height should be. That is something that they can have a lot more control over. since the random might not get out as far as they want.
add more connections
	other monkey bars
	zipline
	tripole
camera tipping over on a shape
